## Stakeholders

### Katarina:
Goals/Needs: 
The interviewee’s primary goal is to keep date planning simple, convenient, and stress-free. She often gives only a short amount of notice before a date and prefers activities that are close to home and easy to organize. Her typical dates lean casual, such as coffee chats, park walks, or occasionally a nice dinner, rather than elaborate multi-part outings. Personal touches matter to her, like bringing flowers that match someone’s personality, especially on a second date. Budget is a major consideration, so she wants date options that are affordable and make it easy to split costs fairly. When planning, she focuses on key details such as the day, time, venue, vibe, and whether reservations are needed. She usually asks friends for inspiration but would appreciate an app that offers lots of fresh suggestions, particularly ones personalized to her partner’s interests. She values variety over a narrow curated set and likes the idea of trending recommendations with clear budget ranges. Convenience is also important — she would prefer links to booking tools like Resy or OpenTable rather than handling everything in-app. Trust in a tool would come from good recommendations, ease of use, and avoiding spam or ads.

Problems/Frustrations:
For her, the hardest part of dating is not the planning itself but finding someone to go out with. She sometimes struggles with running out of inspiration, leaving her to repeat the same types of dates. Overly complicated plans feel overwhelming, and she has no interest in bundled, multi-stop “perfect” itineraries. Budget pressures add another layer of stress, making her wary of expensive or unclear options. She would also be frustrated if an app kept showing the same venues after she had dismissed them. Since she doesn’t currently use any date-planning tools, she is somewhat skeptical about adopting one and would only do so if the recommendations were genuinely helpful. Finally, she is sensitive to annoyance; a tool that felt repetitive, spammy, or ad-heavy would quickly turn her away.

### Arafat
Goals/Needs:
Arafat’s approach to planning dates is heavily inspired by social media, especially TikTok, where he looks for quick recommendations that show the activity, food, price, and overall vibe in one short video. His date preferences vary depending on the time of day — adventurous outings during the day, and dinner-focused dates at night. When planning, he prioritizes practical details such as whether a venue has parking, which makes a location more appealing. Budget isn’t a strict limitation, but he wants the money spent to feel worthwhile and aligned with the quality of the experience. He is open to bundled date plans, like dinner plus an activity and dessert, but only if everything is organized seamlessly for him. How he shares his plans depends on the situation: for special occasions, he prefers to keep it a surprise, while for casual outings, he gives his date advance notice. Arafat also uses ChatGPT as a resource, in addition to TikTok, for generating ideas and exploring options.

Problems/Frustrations:
While TikTok is his primary source of inspiration, Arafat finds it unreliable at times. Sponsored content can exaggerate the quality of food or misrepresent an experience, which leads to disappointment. Social media posts also don’t always provide practical information like the best times to go, which can make planning more frustrating. Although budget isn’t his main concern, he dislikes when an experience feels overpriced or not worth the cost. Finding a place to eat is often the hardest part of planning for him, suggesting a gap in tools that could filter and validate options more reliably. He would find value in an app that suggested unique date ideas near him, especially if it combined trustworthy information with convenience. However, he prefers that the app point him to external platforms for reservations and purchases, rather than handling transactions directly.
