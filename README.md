As a user, I want to add a place to my Saved list with one tap so that I can quickly keep track of spots I plan to visit or liked before.  

As a user, I want to remove a place from my Saved list so that I can keep the list clean and only keep items I want.  

As a user, I want to add a short note to a saved place (i.e “best at 6pm”, “great for coffee”) so that I remember why I saved it and any tips for next time.  

As a user, I want to share a saved place via a simple link so that I can send it to my partner or friends.
